# Largo-Sample-Child-Theme
An example WordPress child theme based on the Largo parent theme (http://github.com/inn/largo)

**WARNING**
We are still working on this so right now it just gives you an example of our preferred directory structure for a child theme (mirroring what we do in the Largo parent theme). 

Soon, it will contain a readme in each folder explaining what goes where, how to modify the behavior/look/feel of Largo and other helpful tips and examples.

If you have specific questions or requests for docs, please open an issue so make sure to address them.
